Our team consists of five members who work agilely with Scrum methodology, utilizing Trello for backlog and user stories management. The project was organized into two sprints, each lasting around two weeks.

We utilized the following technologies:

    Vue.js
    Pinia
    ESLint
    Prettier
    Bootstrap

The components I primarily worked on were:

    ResultPageStudents
    HeaderLogo
    NavBar
    TestPageStudents

I customized Bootstrap's default colors using custom.scss. Additionally, I collaborated with my team on store.js. We successfully implemented user creation functionality, focusing initially on students. Later, I added a "last logged-in" feature to indicate which student/user was currently logged in. We used local storage to persist user data and points, which were displayed on both the student result page and the teacher-side interface.

Due to time constraints, we were unable to implement visual representations of the results using diagrams, as well as providing students with access to their previous results. These were ideas we had for further development of the application.
