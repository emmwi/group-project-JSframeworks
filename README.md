# group-project-JSframeworks
A group project in school where we used vue.js, pinia-store, eslint, prettier, bootstrap 
I worked mostly on the components called ResultPageStudents, HeaderLogo, NavBar, TestPageStudents. 
I changed default colors for bootstrap with custom.scss, worked togehter with people in my group on store.js and also a bit on my own to make the login work and to be able to show the name on the person who is logged in, we didnt have time to finish everything on the teacherside.
